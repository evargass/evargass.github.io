Welcome! I am an Economist working in the intersection between research and public policy. Currently, I am the Policy and Research Manager of the [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/LAC) in the Dominican Republic. In the last years, I led and collaborated with local governments from Peru, the Dominican Republic, Chile, and the United States to implement and evaluate several programs to improve families’ education investments and enhance the efficiency of education markets. I recieved my BS from the [Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/) and I am an alumnus of the Program on Leadership, Liberal Arts and Public Service of Brown University and the Botin Foundation, and a Policy partner of [ConsiliumBots](www.consiliumbots.com)
