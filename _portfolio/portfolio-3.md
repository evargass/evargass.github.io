title: "Building a better future with informed investment in higher education: Evaluating the impact of personalized provision of information on earnings and financial aid in the Dominican Republic"
excerpt: "As a joint initiative between J-PAL and the Social Policy Coordination Cabinet (GCPS) from the Dominican government, we are implementing and evaluating a policy pilot intended to increase access to post-secondary education among the young vulnerable population of the Dominican Conditional Cash Transfer Program [PROSOLI](https://progresandoconsolidaridad.gob.do). To achieve this goal, the project aims to equip PROSOLI's social workers with an Artificial Intelligence Assistant -through a mobile APP- that will provide customized guidance to senior high school students in their transition to tertiary education."
