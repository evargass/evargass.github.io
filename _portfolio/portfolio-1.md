In this project, I supervised the data collection process, cleaned and analyzed data to elaborate reports about the effectiveness of the informational intervention. I also closely coordinated with the Ministry of Education, who was the main partner in the evaluation. After finding positive effects of the program, it was scaled up and the intervention contents were incorporated in the national curriculum.
