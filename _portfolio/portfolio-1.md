In this project I supervised the data collection process, clean and analyze data to ellaborate reports about the effectiveness of the informational intervention. I also closely coordinate with the Ministry of Education who was the main partner in the evaluation. After finding positive effects of the program, it was scaled up and the intervention contents where incorporated in the national curriculum.
