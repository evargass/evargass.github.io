title: "Decidiendo por un Futuro Mejor (DFM)"
excerpt: "DFM is a large scale policy pilot that aimed to reduce drop-out rates in Peru. The project provided families with information about the economic and social returns of completing basic education and completing tertiary education. In this way, the intervention corrects families' erroneous expectations about the benefits of studying and improve their education investment decisions."

In this project, I supervised the data collection process, cleaned and analyzed data to elaborate reports about the effectiveness of the informational intervention. Also, I closely coordinated with the Ministry of Education, who was the main partner in the evaluation, to implement the intervention. After finding positive effects, the program was scaled up and the intervention contents were incorporated in the national curriculum.
