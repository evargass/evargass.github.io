As the Research Associated leading this project I took care of all the stages of the project. In particular, I elaborated two complex statistical designs for the surveys to guarantee the representativeness of the undergraduate population and recent graduate population at the following levels: national level, university level, career level, and in the most important university-career combinations.

I also played an important role in the elaboration of the questionnaires and the supervision of fieldwork activities. I monitored 200 surveyors collecting information in all the 24 regions of the country. At the end of the process, we interviewed more than 40,000 people.
