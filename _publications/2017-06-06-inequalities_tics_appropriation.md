This study discusses the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially the Internet, in three Latin American capitals in people’s ability to attain the lifestyle they value and how inequalities in this ability or “information richness” can be explained by sociodemographic characteristics that do not depend on the individual’s decisions. The analysis is conducted using an Information Richness Index (IRI) that includes information about the three barriers that people face in making significant use of the Internet: access to the Internet, skills for using ICTs, and the ability to function well in digital environments. Econometric estimations show that women, people who are not active in the workforce, and older adults, particularly senior citizens, have lower IRI levels, while each additional year of education and belonging to learning communities have a positive effect on the level a person achieves.
